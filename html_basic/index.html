        <h1>My Frontend Assignment with ALX</h1>
        <p>I’ve recently started learning HTML as part of my frontend development course with ALX. This assignment is my first step into the world of web development, and I’m excited to see how much I can learn. It's challenging, but I enjoy the process of understanding how websites are built from the ground up</p>

        <h2>What I’m Learning</h2>
        <p>Through this assignment, I’m getting hands-on experience with basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. </p>
        <p>I’ve learned how to structure a webpage and how to use tags properly to display content. The most interesting part so far is how HTML creates the structure of a webpage, and I can’t wait to dive deeper into web development.</p>
 
        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
        <p>I’m looking forward to finishing this assignment and moving on to more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript. The journey has just begun, and I’m excited to keep building my skills with ALX.</p>
